# Path Finding Visualizer: python project

## The Project:
This project implements path finding algorithms and visualizes them using pygame. 
Currently, this project has the A*, Breadth-First Search, snd Depth-First search path finding algorithms,
but will feature more in the future.

## Tutorial:
To operate the path finding visualizer, use your mouse and keyboard in the following fashion. 
Whilst the algorithm is running the only key you can press is the escape key.
- Right click: place a block on the grid. If there is no start and/or end point, these points will be placed first, 
  respectfully, otherwise a barrier will be placed.
- Left click: erase a block from the grid.
- c key press: clear the board completely.
- escape key press: stop an algorithm while it's running.
- a key press: run the A* algorithm.
- b key press: run the BFS algorithm.
- d key press: run the DFS algorithm.
